================

VAST is really just a networking library so it does not have a standalone
program to run. The current VAST interface provides a few simple things you can
do (defined in /include/vast.h)

                                                        VAST functions
                                                        --------------
    1) set an initial position for your node            (join)
    2) move the node                                    (move)
    3) query a list of area of interest (AOI) neighbors (get_nodes)


However, to faciliate the understanding of how VAST works, we have two demos for
Win32. One is called "VASTsim_gui", a graphical view of a simulation of nodes;
and the other is "demo_chatva", a simple chat client where users can see and
talk to their AOI neighbors.

To see the simulation, simply build the project "VASTsim_gui" and run the
executable, the controls are:

    ENTER:	                begin simulation
    SPACE:	                toggle "step mode"
    left-click	            select node to view
    right-click	            show remote node's AOI
    'F':	                toggle "follow mode"
    'E':	                toggle "Voronoi edges"
    'C':	                toggle "stop on inconsistency"
    'O':	                restore viewport to origin
    'W', 'S', 'A', 'D':	    move viewport
    'Q':	                quit demo

To run the simple chat program, build "demo_chatva". Then type

demo_chatva [IP address]

If [IP address] is empty, the node will run as a gateway. Otherwise [IP address]
should be the address for the gateway. If you want to run a non-GUI gateway, simply build
the project "demo_gateway", and execute with the command:

demo_gateway {self IP} {AOI radius}

where both parameters are required.
