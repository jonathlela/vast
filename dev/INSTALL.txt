ACE is required for using the real network layer (as opposed to an emulated one 
for simulation purposes). Please see the instructions below:

    Win32
    -----
    You need to copy the appropriate ACE libraries from the directory 
    "/ACE_wrappers" into "/bin". 

    "ACE.dll"  is for the Release Build and 
    "ACEd.dll" is for the Debug Build. 

    You may simply run "addDLL-VC8.bat" (VC++ 2005) or
                       "addDLL-VC7.bat" (VC++ 2003)
    to copy the respective libraries to the /bin directory.


    Linux
    -----
    NOTE: you will need to build ACE for your own platform to run . First obtain 
    copy of ACE 5.5 or later at: http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/Download.html
    
    If you just want to run "VASTsim_console" (simulator only), 
    you can define the flag ACE_DISABLED in "/include/config.h"
    and simply type "make noace" to build
        
    after unzipping ACE to a local directory, do the following 
    under that directory:
        
        mkdir build     (to create a temporary work directory)
        cd build
        ../configure    (to configure ACE for your platform automatically)
        make            (build ACE and store it in "lib")
        make install    (install ACE to "usr/local/lib")

        set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to where ACE is installed 
        (by default: "usr/local/lib")



Win32 Instructions
------------------

To build VAST in Win32, simply click on "VAST.sln" for VC++ 2003
then choose the appropriate projects. All compiled binaries are put 
into the "bin" directory. We also support the free version 
of VC++ 2005 (the "Express" version, by clicking "VAST-vc8.sln"), 
which can be downloaded at:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/ 

Also, note that you will need to first install the Microsoft Platform SDK
to include support for the networking libraries. See the following
for more details:

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/express/aa700755.aspx

make sure that all instructions for modifying the setting in VC++ 2005 
are followed.

VC++ 6.0 becomes unsupported since version 0.3.2. However, if you 
still intend to build VAST with VC++ 6.0, you must apply SP5 or above 
for VAST to build correctly. Otherwise you might receive the following 
error:

    fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
    
Please see the following for additional information.

http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb;en-us;890892&spid=3042&sid=10



Linux Instructions
------------------
1. Unzip the source files into a work directory

    unzip -a vast-c++-x.x.x.zip
    
    
2. Build the static library of VAST

    cd vast-x.x.x
    make        (this should create "libvast.a" and "libvastsim.a" under the /lib directory)
    
    or
    
    make noace  (if you have turn on the ACE_DISABLED flag in /include/config.h)
    
    
3. Build related library

    ACE and zlib are required for VAST to build properly, please see the instructions 
    above for how to obtain and build ACE. zlib may have already been installed on
    your Linux system, if not, you can obtain a copy and build instructions at
    http://www.zlib.net/
    
    
4. Build demo programs

    depend on which one you'd like to build, just go into the directory under 
    /demo and type "make", the compiled binary will be placed under "/bin" 
    
    NOTE: currently, only "demo/demo_gateway" and "sim/VASTsim_console" have 
    been tested under Linux
 
    
5. Execute the demo
    
    run the demo under /bin
    
    
6. clean up the library

    make TARGET=clean
